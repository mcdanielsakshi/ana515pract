Instructions for all projects:

**If there is more than one datafile, you need to combine the two files into one datafile. (5 points) 
**You should include visuals (histogram, boxplot, graphs, …) for at least 2 variables. (10 points) 
**Your code must include comments to describe what is being done. When dealing with missing data, outliers and errors, make sure you justify why you handled them the way that you did. You can write this in your #comments in the code. (15 points)
